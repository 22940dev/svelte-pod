        <p class="writing">
          Podcasts have become a cultural phenomenon! They can inform, teach,
          entertain, and much much more! Everyone loves them, including me!
        </p>
        <p class="writing">
          The problem I encountered was there was no where I could go and just
          type in "Developer Podcasts" and find them. Not just find them but
          find the good ones. I searched and searched. Made my own list... but
          then I had to spend the time listeneing to every single one, just to
          find out which one was good. This has taken hours and I am still
          finding more and more that I want to try out.
        </p>
        <p class="writing">
          The solution... Developer Podcasts. Here you can submit podcasts that
          you like, have listened to, and enjoyed. The community can rank them
          so when anyone looks at the page they know immediately which podcasts
          are great.
